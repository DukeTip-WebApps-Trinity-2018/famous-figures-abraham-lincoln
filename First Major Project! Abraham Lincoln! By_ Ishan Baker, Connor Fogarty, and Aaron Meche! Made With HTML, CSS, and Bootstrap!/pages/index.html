    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p class="body1">Abraham Lincoln was born in Hardin County, Kentucky on February 12, 1809. He started his life in a log cabin. He was
        born to Thomas and Nancy Lincoln. His mother died when Abraham was just nine years old. His father made him work
        hard in his early life and it was for this reason that Abraham's relationship with his father was very weak. His
        father, a year after Nancy's death, married another widow, Sarah Johnston. Abraham quickly bonded with her. She encouraged
        him to read. Abraham was known to walk miles to borrow a book.</p>
    <h2 class="p2">Family</h2>
    <p class="body2">In 1837, Abraham became romatically involved with a woman named Anne Rutledge. Unfortunately, Anne was killed by typhoid
        fever and the couple were not able to marry. In November of 1842, Abraham married Mary Todd. Previously, they had
        been engaged, but the engagement had been called off. Later, they met at a social function and married. </p>
    <h2 class="p3">Political Career</h2>
    <p class="body3">In 1834, Abraham was elected to the Illinois state legislature. He decided to become a lawyer and, after reading law
        books, he became a lawyer in 1837. He had a successful career as a lawyer. From 1847 to 1849, he served in the US
        house of representatives. In 1857, Lincoln decided to challenge US senator Stephen Douglas for his seat. Lincoln
        and Doiglas participated in many debates across Illinois. These debates were spread by newspapers and gave Lincoln
        political experience on a national level.</p>
    <h2 class="p4">Presidency</h2>
    <p class="body4">In 1860, he bested other, notable competitors at the Republican National Convention. He went on to win at the national
        level, even beating his longtime competitor, Stephen Douglass. After leading the United States through the Civil
        War and giving human rights to African Americans, he was fatally shot while at a theater in Washington D.C. His assasinator,
        John Wilkes Booth, thought he was helping the South. Booth was tracked and killed 12 days after the assasination.</p>
